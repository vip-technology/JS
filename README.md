# JS
JS and ES concept examples

This repo will focus on creating examples for code to help us understand the inner workings of JS.
Next step will be to make that code such that it can be understandable by other developers.
Last step will be to migrate the finalized code which is ready to become a module or plugin and can serve some purpose in helping others.
